# To-Do List

## Fields

* IsCritical := Total Slack <= Project.ShowCriticalSlack
* Task.Predecessors
* Task.Successors

I'm still not happy with the way the interactions work:

* Right now, our policy layer lives at the object model layer but all the field
  setting is expressed as modifications over `ProjectData`. However, the policy
  for structure changes (adding and removing tasks for instance), isn't. This
  results in weird cases where some field setters end up using `Project`
  instances to create instances of `ProjectData` but with applied policy.
  Clearly, that's not right.

* We can either move all policy back to `ProjectData`, with the understanding
  that (virtually) everything in the system has to go through
  `ProjectData.SetValue(Id, Field, Value)` (as opposed to being able to set
  fields on `TaskData` directly).

* Alternatively, we can say that all policy is done at the object model. The
  downside is that we need to find another way to do scheduling. Right now, we
  schedule every time a `Project` is created. Long term, we probably don't want
  this anyway, so maybe it's time to bit the bullet and introduce an internal
  `Schedule` method?

* However, my gut feel is that the object model layer is the wrong way to do it
  though, as it probably creates more objects than necessary and prevents policy
  operations from performing any optimizations. But it's probably also true that
  optimizations are a bad idea as it implies that the changes aren't routed
  through a centralized policy system. Still, I'm leaning moving the
  functionality down, but this time to `ProjectData` which ensures the policy
  can access (and modify) the entire project state, if necessary.

## Naming & Exceptions

* We should rename the parameters of all single-argument `WithXxx` methods to
  just `value`.

* Exceptions that are a result of validating field values should at most be
  thrown one level down in the `ProjectData` component. Ideally, we should align
  parameter names so that we can just throw `ArgumentExceptions` and not feel
  too bad about it.

## Basics

* Add hierarchical tasks
* Add effort driven
* Add task type
* Add other predecessor types
* Add scheduling from the back
* Add actual work
* Add percent complete

## UI

* Handle errors

## Settings

* Creating custom types for duration and work so we can store the unit (minutes,
  hours, days, week, months) and whether it was estimated
* We should add all the project settings, such as
  - hours per day
  - hours per week
  - days per month
  - Tasks are critical if slack is less than or equal to
  - Note: Project has a default start time and default finish times for tasks.
    However, those don't seem to be used unless the task is manually scheduled;
    task dates snap to the calendar being used.
