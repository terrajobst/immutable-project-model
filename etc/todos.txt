# To-Do List

## Naming & Exceptions

* We should rename the parameters of all single-argument `WithXxx` methods to
  just `value`.

* Exceptions that are a result of validating field values should at most be
  thrown one level down in the `ProjectData` component. Ideally, we should align
  parameter names so that we can just throw `ArgumentExceptions` and not feel
  too bad about it.

## Basics

* Add hierarchical tasks
* Add effort driven
* Add task type
* Add other predecessor types
* Add scheduling from the back
* Add actual work
* Add percent complete
* Add successors

## Settings

* Creating custom types for duration and work so we can store the unit (minutes,
  hours, days, week, months) and whether it was estimated
* We should add all the project settings, such as
  - hours per day
  - hours per week
  - days per month
  - Tasks are critical if slack is less than or equal to
  - Note: Project has a default start time and default finish times for tasks.
    However, those don't seem to be used unless the task is manually scheduled;
    task dates snap to the calendar being used.
