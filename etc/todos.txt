# To-Do List

## Naming & Exceptions

* We should rename the parameters of all single-argument `WithXxx` methods to
  just `value`.

* Exceptions that are a result of validating field values should at most be
  thrown one level down in the `ProjectData` component. Ideally, we should align
  parameter names so that we can just throw `ArgumentExceptions` and not feel
  too bad about it.

## Calendars

* `Calendar` needs an id
* Tasks have an associated calendar (by default none)
* Resources have an associated calendar (when they are created they will default
  to the project calendar)
* When scheduling an assignment, we need to intersect the task and the resource
  calendar (unless the task ignores the resource calendar)
* If the default work week for both calendars have no overlap, we ignore the
  resource calendar and just use the task calendar. It seems there is a private
  field on the assignment that carries that information.  

## Basics

* Add hierarchical tasks
* Add constraints
* Add effort driven
* Add task type
* Add scheduling from the back
* Add actual work
* Add percent complete

## Settings

* Creating custom types for duration and work so we can store the unit (minutes,
  hours, days, week, months) and whether it was estimated
* We should add all the project settings, such as
  - hours per day
  - hours per week
  - days per month
  - Tasks are critical if slack is less than or equal to
  - Note: Project has a default start time and default finish times for tasks.
    However, those don't seem to be used unless the task is manually scheduled;
    task dates snap to the calendar being used.
