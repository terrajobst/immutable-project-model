# To-Do List

## Basics

* Add hierarchical tasks

* Add percent complete

## UI

* Adding & removing tasks
* Adding & removing assignments
* Adding & removing resources

## Settings

We should add all the project settings, such as hours per day, hours per week,
days per month.

Project has a default start time and default finish times for tasks. However,
those don't seem to be used unless the task is manually scheduled; task dates
snap to the calendar being used.
