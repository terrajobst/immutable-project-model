# To-Do List

## Basics

* Disallow cycles in predecessors
* Add hierarchical tasks
* Add effort driven
* Add task type
* Add other predecessor types
* Add scheduling from the back
* Add actual work
* Add percent complete

## UI

* Allow selecting columns
* Handle errors
* Adding & removing tasks
* Adding & removing assignments
* Adding & removing resources

## Settings

* Creating custom types for duration and work so we can store the unit (minutes,
  hours, days, week, months) and whether it was estimated
* We should add all the project settings, such as hours per day, hours per week,
  days per month.
  - Note: Project has a default start time and default finish times for tasks.
    However, those don't seem to be used unless the task is manually scheduled;
    task dates snap to the calendar being used.
