# To-Do List

## Basics

* Add assignment units
* Add effort driven
* Add task type
* Add other predecessor types
* Add scheduling from the back

## Settings

We should add all the project settings, such as hours per day, hours per week,
days per month.

Project has a default star time and default finish times for tasks. Are those
used or are tasks scheduled based on the calendar? What happens if our calendar
starts at 9 AM but the default start time is still 8 AM?
